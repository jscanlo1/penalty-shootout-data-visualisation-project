# Penalty Shootout Data Visualisation Project

This project was part of a course for data visualistion in my 5th year at Trinity College

I chose to do mine on penalty shootouts, and the statistical odds of success for a given approach.

Visualisation can be found by downloading the Tableau workbook, opening and going to presentation mode.
